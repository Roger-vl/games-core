# Second Assignment

## Game: Shape wars

This game has one player, the shape without fill color, the 
objective is to destroy the shapes "enemies" that spawn every 
often, to do so you can shoot bullets with mouse left click, also 
you can spawn a special power "Super Bullet" that destroy 
everything in its path.

> I hope you can have as much fun time playing this as I building it.
